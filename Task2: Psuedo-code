The aim of my pseudo-code is to improve a user's driving experience in a car.

Which model car did you drive? = HR-V or CR-V.
    print = "Great choice, please allow a few more questions to be asked to improve your drive."

How far did you travel this month? > 500 (km)
    print with a dropbox, "Do you normally drive this distance or do you drive more than 500km per month?" 
       if user selects the button = "normally"
          print = "What about the car makes it convenient to travel this distance?"
            user will then be allowed to input their own answer.

       if user selects the button = "more than 500km"
          print = "What about the car makes it convenient to travel this distance?"
            user will then be allowed to input their own answer.

Would you suggest Honda to a friend or family member? = yes
         print = "Great! we are happy to hear this!"
      if user selects the button = no
         print = "We are sorry to hear this, what can we do to improve your drive and change your mind?"
         user will then be allowed to input their own answer.
