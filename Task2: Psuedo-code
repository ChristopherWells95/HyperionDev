The aim of my pseudo-code is to improve a user's driving experience in a car.

1. Which model car did you drive? = HR-V or CR-V.
    return = "Great choice, please allow a few more questions to be asked to improve your drive."

2. How far did you travel this month? > 500 (km)
    return with a dropbox, "Do you normally drive this distance or do you drive more than 500km per month?" 
       if user selects the button = "normally"
          return = "What about the car makes it convenient to travel this distance?"
            user will then be allowed to type in their own answer.

       if user selects the button = "more than 500km"
          return = "What about the car makes it convenient to travel this distance?"
            user will then be allowed to type in their own answer.

3. Would you suggest Honda to a friend or family member? = yes
         return = "Great! we are happy to hear this!"
      if user selects the button = no
         return = "We are sorry to hear this, what can we do to improve your drive and change your mind?"
         user will then be allowed to type in their own answer.
