Purpose of my psuedocode would be to work out how much money someone has, will and can spend.

1. Have you spent money twice or more in the past 24-hours? = yes
      return, "Try to save your money"
           if answer = no,
               return, "You must be very wise." 

2. Will you be planning to spend money again in the next 24-hours? = yes
      return, "Make sure it is completely necessary to do so"
          if answer = no,
              return, "Seems like you are saving for a rainy day"

3. How much money can you spend without feeling bad? > 2000
      return, "WOW! you must be a big spender"
          if answer < 2000
              return, "You know the value of money"


// not sure if this was what the task requested, looking forward to the feedback. //
